There is nothing wrong with that. No one picks this up expecting William Faulkner. <br/><br/>But the content was so distasteful that its hard to read. It could have been an interesting book with great stories from the field. But it seemed to all be about how bad ass Chris is and how everyone else is inadequate. He is extremely vulgar, disrespectful of human life, and stuck on how evil anyone from a different culture is. <br/><br/>This is one of those books that some people will love and others will hate. I happen to hate it. Its not like I haven't heard talk like this before, I just didn't expect it in a book like this. A camp fire with your friends, maybe, but not when you publish a work representing your country and some of the bravest men in the world.  The sexist, racist, vulgar, and megalomaniac crap that is weaved into every single story ruined this book. I was very disappointed. ","","","","","",0,,,,,

It makes it into a who is better competition. That is really not what I expected. This book also really skips over the understanding of the spectrum that people can operate in, and goes strait to the bashing and sarcasm to try to encourage quiet people. With all the extrovert examples being over the top self promoters, yeah, they are going to seem like crazy people. But thats so wrong. And so is the idea that introverts are weak and can't handle social situations.  I work with amazing introverted leaders. There is definitely less desire to be in the spotlight but they are not incapable of it and do very well. This book seems to exaggerate the problem. <br/><br/>Next there are a series of chapters that essentially give you a list of excuse options from physiology to brain processes that are uncontrollable if you feel anxiety. Its not well founded research or at least feels like she is stretching good research to make her own points. Either way, I was put off enough and disappointed from the tone of the book that I gave up on it as something that might give me more constructive understanding of extravert and introvert personality styles.  Its unfinished and will just have to stay that way. There are way better books out there to help me understand different personalities and temperments. ","","","","","",0,,,,,

A lot of it is unrealistic, which is fine, but combined with the fundamentalism and family survival guide themes its too fake for me. ","","","","","",0,,,,,

I kept putting it down and coming back to it. Its not enthrawling, but many stories put together. There are some parts that no other book can touch. <br/><br/>I love it for what stands for... the fact that we need wilderness and that you can not drive to wilderness in your car or buy a ticket to see it. I also love how it makes the desert beautiful.  <br/><br/>I listened to it on audible and the readers mellow and rustic voice with the sarcastic undertones seem to match Abbey's sentiment perfectly. I even appreciated the pace and the pauses in the reading. It was very well done. ","","","","","",0,,,,,

My biggest problem with it is that Krakauer almost glamorizes Chris's immature romanticization of living in the wild. It is a tragedy and the final outcome is not an adventure we would want to follow but the whole rest of the book leaves you with a little bit of longing to live the story. Even the title of 'Into the Wild' is enticing. It should be called 'Alone and Ignorant'<br/><br/>So many people love this book and point to it and Chris as an example of an adventurer and free spirit. The real story is dropped relationships and a fear of facing his issues.  He is not seeking adventure or appreciating the wilderness. He is running away from dealing with his family and own problems. He is an unhealthy person.  I would suggest something from Edward Abbey for a more intelligent and thoughtful perspective on 'the wild'.  ","","","","","",0,,,,,

The over all story is exciting and adventurous.  There are just a few slow parts.  I love the character development of Buck (even though he is a dog).  He becomes smarter, more aware, and more dangerous.  This book makes the adventurous side of me rise to the top a bit and that is partly why I like it so much.  On the flip side I really dis-like the counter story of white fang, where a wild wolf becomes a house dog, not because the writing is not good but just the principle of the story.

Got it, I will make some checklist for mundane tasks like grabbing all my backcountry ski gear before going on a trip. Don't want to forget the beacon or skins.  <br/><br/>I know they are useful and can help us not forget things that will matter later.  I'd rather learn better strategies and tools for being productive at work. I though the conclusions of this book were so simple that it does not need to be a book, maybe a blog post.
